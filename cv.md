My goal is to consume all knowledges i can get from this course, to be better in programming and finally get a job.
My skills is very low in all sorts of programming languages.
Code example:
I have no experience in programming.
I didn't complete or participate in any programing courses.
My english experience consis–µt of several years of studying in university.
